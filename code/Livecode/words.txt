1. Create a service class called CustomerService which will allow you to interact with Customer
resources. The CustomerService class should allow you to
1. Retrieve a Customer using a customer id.
2. Retrieve all customers.
3. Insert a customer.
Optionally, you can add functionality to update and delete a customer.
You can decide if you want to also create a CustmerDAO to be the keeper of the data.
The Customer class should have at least the following properties:
1. An integer id
2. A name
3. A dateOfBirth of type LocalDate
1. You can initialize a LocalDate with the of method, e.g. LocalDate.of(1957, 10, 10)
4. Zero or more phone numbers
5. A status, which can have the following values:
• Privileged
• Normal

You can add any other properties you want.
Write some code to test your classes. This can be either in the form of a main method or unit
tests.
